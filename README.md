# Erdos-Renyi Randomized Graph Generator

Note to self: invoke `pip freeze > requirements.txt` everytime I update the list of dependencies.

This project is done for a class assignment involving the gneeration and analysis of Erdos Renyi randomized graphs. It will mainly be done in Python, and feature a GUI that displays the graphs, and identifies cycles, connected components, and etc.

The usage will consists of running flags and arguments in for executing certain tasks. Be sure to use an environment with all of the packages listed in `requirements.txt` present.
```python
# TODO: everything
```

### Directories
- The `data/` directory will start the `.gml` files related to graph modelling.
- The `utils/` directory will contain all of the additional `.py` modules used for the program.
